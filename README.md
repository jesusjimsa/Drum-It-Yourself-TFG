Electric drumset using sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards.

The sensors are connected to the Arduino board, which receives the values read by the force sensors, and generates a message that will be sent to the Raspberry Pi.

In the Raspberry Pi, the messages are read and parsed to select an audio file to play in a speaker.

This is all set in an structure to simulate a drumset.
